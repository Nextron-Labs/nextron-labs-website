The Sigma project continues to evolve with significant updates in 2025. This post covers the key changes and how to leverage them in your detection engineering workflow.

## New Correlation Syntax

The most requested feature has finally arrived. Sigma now supports native correlation rules that can detect patterns across multiple events:

```yaml
title: Suspicious Process Chain
correlation:
  type: event_count
  rules:
    - process_creation_*
  group-by:
    - ComputerName
  timespan: 5m
  condition:
    gte: 10
```

## Improved Field Modifiers

Several new field modifiers make rule writing more expressive:

- `|cidr` - Match IP addresses against CIDR ranges
- `|windash` - Normalize Windows command line dash variations
- `|expand` - Expand environment variables for comparison

## Migration Guide

If you're running older Sigma rules, the conversion is straightforward. The `sigma-cli` tool now includes a migration command:

```bash
sigma migrate --input old-rules/ --output new-rules/
```

The tooling will automatically update deprecated syntax while preserving detection logic.
